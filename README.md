# Project 1 - Graph generation and management library.
Project made by Omar Alejandro Linares Escobar for the subject "Design and Analysis of Algorithms".
## Objective of the project. 
Generate random graphs through 6 different methods, which are:
* Merge Method
* Erdös & Rény Method
* Gilbert Method
* Simple Geographic Method
* Barabási-Albert Method
* Dorogovtsev-Mendes Method

For each method, 3 different graphs were generated, which had 30, 100 and 500 nodes.
Each graph generates a .GV file, which allowed to generate through Gephi, its corresponding .PNG image.
