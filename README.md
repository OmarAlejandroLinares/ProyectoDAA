# Project 1 - Graph generation and management library.
Project made by Omar Alejandro Linares Escobar for the subject "Design and Analysis of Algorithms".
## Objective of the project. 
Generate random graphs through 6 different methods, which are:
* Merge Method
* Erdös & Rény Method
* Gilbert Method
* Simple Geographic Method
* Barabási-Albert Method
* Dorogovtsev-Mendes Method

For each method, 3 different graphs were generated, which had 30, 100 and 500 nodes.  
Each graph generates a **.gv** file, which allowed to generate through Gephi, its corresponding **.png** image.

## How to test the project?
In order to correctly replicate the results obtained with this project, the following steps must be followed:
1. Download the files and store them in the same folder
2. Run the code *graph* which will store the 18 graph files in a folder called *gv*
3. Open each of the generated files in the *Gephi* software and export them in **.png** format

## Functioning
